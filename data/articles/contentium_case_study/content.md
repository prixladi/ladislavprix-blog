Contentium is a project you can use for creating sites with semi-static content. The project uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) as the main framework, [mdx](https://mdxjs.com/) to render markdown, [Prism.js](https://prismjs.com/) for code highlights, and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styles. You can find the project on [Github](https://github.com/prixladi/contentium).

Content is generated from `./data` folder that is the root of the project. The folder contains `settings.json` file that contains the basic settings for a site. Example below:

```json
{
    "autosearchTresholdCount": "100",
    "metaDescription": "This is example blog of Contentium project.",
    "mainFooter": "Copyright 2021 Â© [Ladislav Prix](mailto:contact@ladislavprix.cz)",
    "mainDescription": "This is example blog made by **Ladislav Prix**.",
    "mainTitle": "My Example blog"
}
```

Then it contains `articles` folder that contains other folders that contain concrete articles. Each article is defined by its own `metadata.json` file. A **Markdown** file with the text itself. **Markdown** file should not contain the main heading because it is taken over from `metadata.json`.

```json 
{
    "title": "Contentium case study",
    "keywordText": "markdown",
    "brief": "**Contentium** is a project.",
    "createdAt": "2021-09-09",
    "author": "Ladislav Prix",
    "readingTimeInMinutes": 5
}
```

## Contentium modes

**Contentium** can be used in two different modes, those can be run natively or using **Docker** image `shamyr/contentium-base` that is exposed from this project.

1. **ISR mode** - ISR mode uses **Incremental static regeneration**, this mode is best when you need to change content while the application is running. This can be done with commands `yarn build` and `yarn start`.
2. **SSG mode** - SSG mode uses **Server side generation**, this mode is best when you don't need to change content *on the fly* and statically generated pages are enough for you. 

### ISR mode

This mode requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) as runtime because it runs **nextjs** server on the backend that performs **Incremental static regeneration**. You can start rhe application in this mode natively using `yarn build` and `yarn start` commands in the project root. Or you can use **Docker** image `shamyr/contentium-base` as you can see below: 

```docker
FROM shamyr/contentium-base as builder
RUN yarn build

FROM node:16-alpine3.11 as runner
WORKDIR /app

COPY --from=builder /app/public ./public
COPY --from=builder /app/.next ./.next
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY --from=builder /app/package.json ./package.json
COPY --from=builder /app/data ./data

EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["yarn", "start"]
```

### SSG mode

This mode generates static pages that can be put to *web server*, [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) for example, and served from there. You can build pages natively using `yarn export`. Or you can use **Docker** image `shamyr/contentium-base` as you can see below:

```docker
FROM shamyr/contentium-base as builder
RUN yarn export

FROM nginx:1.21.1-alpine

COPY --from=builder /app/docker/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
COPY --from=builder /app/out /usr/share/nginx/html

CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```
